\f0\fs24 \cf0 LEVEL BLOCKS\
\'a92017 The Dork Arts LLC\
\
LEVEL BLOCKS are designed to work at a scale compatible with the character controllers found in the Unity \'93Standard Assets\'94. To explore the \'93Level Depot\'94 and other sample scenes, it\'92s recommended that you first import that package, then drag the desired character controller into the scene hierarchy and place it in the scene accordingly.\
\

\i *The \'93Modular Tower\'94 prefab is the only piece that will require modifying the character controller\'92s capsule collider to a Radius of 0.4.\
